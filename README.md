# chosen-pawn
Hexapawn inspired game in Java. Made in compliance with CMSC 22 course final project.

# 🕹️ Overview
The Chosen Pawn is a two-player strategy game inspired by a unique version of chess called Hexapawn. The game is composed of a 5x5 tiled chess board with both players having 5 pawns on each side. Before the game starts, each player chooses a pawn to be “Chosen” which only that player knows. The game then continues, following standard chess rules but with only pawns on the board. However, during a player’s turn, they can choose to promote their Chosen pawn to Knight, Rook or Bishop. This feature allows additional skill expression for the players, allowing unique opportunities for deception and outplay. The goal of the game is to prevent your opponent from performing any more moves by capturing every pawn or putting them in a position that doesn’t allow any more moves.
